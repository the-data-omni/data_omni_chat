The scientific name of the endangered plant species is Welwitschia mirabilis.,"The typical habitat of Welwitschia mirabilis is the arid desert regions of southwestern Africa, specifically in Namibia and Angola. It thrives in areas with low rainfall, high temperatures, and well-drained sandy soils, often-growing in association with other succulent plants and shrubs. Welwitschia mirabilis is commonly found on rocky outcrops, gravel plains, and sandy dunes, where it can survive with minimal water and nutrients.",Vulnerable
"The scientific name of the endangered plant species is Attenborough's Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes attenboroughii.","Attenborough's Pitcher Plant (Nepenthes attenboroughii) is typically found in the habitats of ultramafic soils and rocky outcrops of Palawan Island in the Philippines. It thrives in areas with high humidity, moderate to bright indirect light, and well-drained soil. The plant's natural habitat is generally characterized by: 
1. Ultramafic soils: These are soils derived from ultramafic rocks, which are rich in magnesium and iron but poor in essential nutrients.
2. Rocky outcrops: The plant grows on rocky outcrops, which provide the necessary support and drainage for its roots.
3. High humidity: Attenborough's Pitcher Plant requires a humid environment, typically between 60-90% relative humidity, to thrive.
4. Moderate to bright indirect light: The plant prefers bright, indirect light, but can tolerate moderate light conditions.
5. Well-drained soil: The soil should be well-drained to prevent waterlogged conditions, which can be detrimental to the plant's health.",Critically Endangered
